# About Me

👋 Thank you for visiting my directory. I am a curious data head, focused more in data engineering but dip my feet in data analytics tasks as well. I am naturally curious, leading me to find solace in data. My superpower is having hemiparesis, which has automatically made me an outside-the-box thinker in my everyday life as well as in my work.

🔍 I learn by doing, so I have a number of repos relating to machine learning, natural language processing, web scraping, data extrapolation and visualization, as well as statistical modeling.

🛠️ Python, SQL, and C++ are the languages I have a strong proficiency in, and build most of my projects through. Although it is practically impossible to keep up with all the new technologies, I strive to stay abreast with the ones I believe will make an impact on my career path.

📈 Currently, I am learning more about visualizations and the various tools that can be beneficial, such as Power BI and Tableau

On a personal note, I love soccer, music and travel.
